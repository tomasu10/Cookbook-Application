# Cookbook App- Tomas Uribe Tobon:
Application can be found [here](https://tomasu10.github.io/Cookbook-Application/)

The Cookbook App is intended to allow the user to search for dozens of different recipes. By requesting recipes from an API (forkify-api) the Cookbook app is able to process the users request and display the available recipes on the UI. The user is able to like/favorite the recipes of their choice which they then can access via a favorites menu. The user can also adjust the serving size of their recipe which then can be added to their shopping list. All persistent data, i.e. the favorites and shopping lists, are saved in local storage in order to be restored upon a page reload. This project was completed in JavaScript.
